# Predicting Game Reviews
## Using scikit-learn and linear regression to find trends in board games

**The Challenge:**  
Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to know if a board game is good *before* you buy it? Let alone before you spend several hours with your friends plodding through the rule book, stumbling through the metaphorical dark. For games that already exist, [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) (BGG) serves as the light. BGG is an only forum, marketplace, and wiki for all things board game related. With a large active community and a database of over 80,000 board games, it is the best place to find a new game to play. The goal of this project was to create a model that can accurately predict game ratings.

 **The Toolkit:**
 * scikit-learn
 * AWS
 * seaborn
 * pandas
